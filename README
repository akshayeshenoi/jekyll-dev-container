# Jekyll VSCode Dev Container

Works with the vscode Dev Container extension.

Clone the repo, install the extension, and run the `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` command.

Then clone the jekyll website source code inside the container to continue development. Standard jekyll commands should work.
